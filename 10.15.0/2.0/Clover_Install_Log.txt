Clover EFI installer log - Tue Aug  6 18:03:25 EEST 2019
Installer version: v2.5k r5033 EFI bootloader
======================================================
Changes:
Mount ESP Beta (r5030): use of a new command line called espfinder to find the ESP that belong with the target volume
using the installer. espfinder is able to find the ESP for standard hfs fylesystem, APFS, CoreStorage, RAID with or without APFS,
Fusion drives... or combined. Is in beta stage and is not used by default, in fact to activate it you have to create a file in "/"
called useespfinder just before running the installer:
sudo touch /useespfinder

- New Drivers directories (r4986): drivers64 and drivers64UEFI are deprecated and now Clover load drivers from
EFI/CLOVER/drivers/BIOS and EFI/CLOVER/drivers/UEFI. The Installer takes the step for the migration without, however,
deleting old directories. Anyway the installers now only update EFI/CLOVER/drivers/ leaving old path untouched.
For retro compatibility new Clover loads drivers from drivers64/drivers64UEFI only if EFI/CLOVER/drivers/(BIOS or UEFI)
are not present. You can safely remove drivers64 and drivers64UEFI using newer revisions.
Additionally, during the migration each driver with the "-64" suffix will be renamed without it.. as Clover is for some
time 64-bit only. None of the mentioned changes affect any functionality

- Conflicting drivers:
VirtualSMC.efi is removed if SMCHelper.efi is selected.
HFSPlus.efi is removed if VBoxHfs.efi is selected or viceversa.
ApfsDriverLoader.efi is removed if apfs.efi is selected or viceversa.
Only one of OsxAptioFixDrv.efi, OsxAptioFix3Drv.efi, AptioMemoryFix.efi, OsxLowMemFixDrv.efi is allowed
and any driver that match with "aptiofix", "memfix" or "memoryfix" will be deleted.

- Drivers off (r4987): installs all drivers available in EFI/CLOVER/drivers/off. This path is ignored by Clover and is only
used as a repository, e.g., if you want move a driver using the EFI Shell or the Finder.

A backup is always made to the root of the target volume.
