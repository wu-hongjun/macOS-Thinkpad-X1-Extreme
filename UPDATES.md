### May Updates
* [20190531] BCM94360CS2 is probably causing my laptop's macOS AND Windows (What???) to freeze, back to 2CS.
* [20190525] ~~Switched to BCM94360CS2, seems like there is no problem...?~~
* [20190524] ~~Due to there is no new features in 10.14.5, I will NOT upgrade. Please tell us how it goes if you do! :)~~
* [20190523] Let's take a moment to pay respect to our hero [Hongyu Wu](https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/1/12081430/overwatch-memorial-wu-hongyu-blizzard), heroes never die! 
* [20190522] Updated some minor things in Readme.MD.
